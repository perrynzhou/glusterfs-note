Many thanks for your interest in improving GlusterFS!

GlusterFS does not use GitHub Pull-Requests. Instead, changes are reviewed
on the Gerrit instance of the Gluster Community at https://review.gluster.org

In order to send your changes for review, follow these steps:

1. login on https://review.gluster.org with your GitHub account
2. add a public ssh-key to your profile on https://review.gluster.org/#/settings/ssh-keys
3. add the Gerrit remote to your locally cloned git repository

   $ git remote add gerrit ssh://$USER@review.gluster.org/glusterfs.git

4. configure the commit hooks

   $ git review --setup

5. post your changes to Gerrit

   $ git review


You may need to install the 'git-review' package if 'git review' is not
available. Note that the hooks for the repository make sure to add a ChangeId
label in the commit messages. Gerrit uses the ChangeId to track single patches
and its updated versions.
