# Regex elaborated:
#   grep -w -> --word-regexp (from the man page)
#      Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.
#      The test is that the matching substring must either be at the
#      beginning of the line, or preceded by a  non-word  constituent
#      character.  Similarly, it must be either at the end of the line or
#      followed by a non-word constituent character.  Word-constituent
#      characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.
#   IOW, the above helps us find the pattern with leading or training spaces
#   or non word consituents like , or ;
#
#   [fF][iI][xX][eE][sS]|[uU][pP][dD][aA][tT][eE][sS])
